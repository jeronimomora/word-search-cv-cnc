        <p>Use this section to write an overview of the assignment. All of the text in your write-up should be <em>in your own words</em>. If you need to add additional HTML features to this document, you can search the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a> website for instructions. To edit the HTML, you can just copy and paste existing chunks and fill in the text and image file names appropriately.</p>
        <o>The website writeup is intended to be a self-contained walkthrough of the assignment: we want this to be a piece of work which showcases your understanding of relevant concepts through both rendered images as well as written explanations about what you did to complete each part of the assignment. Try to be as clear and organized as possible when writing about your own output files or extensions to the assignment. We want to understand what you've achieved and how you've done it!</p> 
        <p>If you are well-versed in web development, feel free to ditch this template and make a better looking page. Just make sure that you include all the components as we've laid them out here. </p>
        <p>For required images, keep the image size fixed at the native width of the file to avoid artifacts. You might want to adjust your rasterizester window size down to be less than 1000 pixels wide if you are working on a retina display screen, since the 1920 by 1280 images will be enormous on normal monitors.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing Lines</h2>
        <p>Describe what you did in Part 1. Show your result here. You could talk about which line rasterizing algorithm you used, any issues you ran into and had to debug (with example images), and any clever modifications you made to the algorithm to reduce the number of special cases.</p>
        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                    <img src="images/example_image.jpg" width="800px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Results Caption: include at least one png of svg/basic/test2.svg in this section</figcaption>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>Here is an example of how to include a simple formula:</p>
        <p align="middle"><pre align="middle">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</pre></p>
        <p>or, alternatively, you can include an image of a LaTex formula.</p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h2>
        <p>Describe what you did in Part 2. Show your result here. Explain any bugs you had to work through, with pictures if possible. Explain any special optimizations you did beyond simple bounding box triangle rasterization, with a timing comparison table (we suggest using the c++ clock() function around the svg.draw() command in DrawRend::redraw() to compare millisecond timings with your various optimizations off and on).</p>
        <p>Here is an example table. You could put timing comparisons here, for example.</p>
        <div align="left">
            <table style="width=100%" border="1px" cellpadding="10px">
                <tr>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 1, Col 1</p>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 1, Col 2</p>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 1, Col 3</p>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 2, Col 1</p>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 2, Col 2</p>
                    <td>
                    <p>Row 2, Col 3</p>
                </tr>
            </table>
